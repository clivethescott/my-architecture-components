# android-architecture-components

Kotlin playground I created for messing about with:

- LifeCycle-aware components
- RxJava2 and RxJava2 integration with Retrofit
- Dependency injection with Dagger2
- MVVM architecture with LiveData and ViewModels
- Using Room cached data when there is no network

Improvements, suggestions etc are always welcome ðŸ˜Ž
